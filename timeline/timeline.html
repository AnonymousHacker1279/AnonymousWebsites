			<p>Website revival. After backing up all website data, we wiped our host device and used a newer operating system installation. After replacing the files and installing our host, it worked! However, we did change the end of our URL from ".hopto.org" to ".ddns.net".</p>

      <h2>August 3, 2019</h2>
      <p>Website revival at GitHub. We moved to GitHub Pages, using a repository on AnonymousHacker1279's account. The page can be used, but there are many bugs we are fixing.</p>

      <h2>September 21, 2019</h2>
      <p>196 changes and 3+ hours of hard work. We made the bug fixes mentioned above (well, hopefully all of them!) and removed some features. The features removed didn't have anything special about them, and most didn't work correctly. The main parts are still there, and they should look familiar. We also made some changes to make the page more HTML5 compatible (This included removing all of the &lt;center&gt; tags, which was very time consuming while we moved to CSS!).</p>

		  <h2>September 23, 2019</h2>
		  <p>We have started to add tech-based news articles (created by the Anonymous Team)! We are also overhauling the interface and styles for many of the overlooked pages, like the tutorial selections. Enjoy!</p>
