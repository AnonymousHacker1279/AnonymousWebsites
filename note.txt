Hello to anyone that reads this.


If you are wondering why our website is randomly offline, just remember you aren't the only one.

The Internet Service Provider that connects to our host device, is a DIRTY and WRONGFUL company.

That ISP is CENTURYLINK.


Because we can host our website for free using Apache, and CenturyLink has their own version of Apache in which you pay
per hour for hosting, they get mad. 

They shut us off because they want us to use their service and waste a ridiculous amount of money. It costs
$0.21 per hour! Imagine running that for a month or two! 

When, or if, we return, please send us feedback on how to prevent this. Changing ISPs isn't an answer, as it is the only one nearby.
