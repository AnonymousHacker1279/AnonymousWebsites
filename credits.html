    <h4>Founder's Note:</h4>
    <p>I started Anonymous Websites. After taking a short semester of simple HTML and CSS, I wanted to make my own website. I started with just a few links and an image. I got my friends together and we started to build something more. Soon, we were getting cool designs (however, not the prettiest!) and making more pages. You can see a timeline of the website <a href="timeline/timeline.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">here</a>.</p>
